# Codex Repo Notes

- All project artifacts (code, docs, comments, commit messages) must remain English-only.
- Keep `main` aligned with upstream; do day-to-day development on the long-lived `dev` branch.
- Ignore upstream task/backlog referencesâ€”treat them as context only and define work as needed for this fork.
- Extended MCP tooling is opt-in: launch with `codex mcp serve --expose-all-tools [--max-aux-agents=N]` to expose the full Codex action set and optional auxiliary agent orchestration.
