# Codex Repo Notes

- All project artifacts (code, docs, comments, commit messages) must remain English-only.
- Keep `main` aligned with upstream; do day-to-day development on the long-lived `dev` branch.
- Ignore upstream task/backlog referencesâ€”treat them as context only and define work as needed for this fork.
